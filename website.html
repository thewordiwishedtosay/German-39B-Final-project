I got rid of everything except the key, and started digging through the dirt to find it’s owner.As I was pulling up a small casket, I heard the slightest sound. A small rustle of leaves. \n\nI peered over the edge and noticed something sitting on top of the box.The lid was empty. I turned to see what had just come out of it, and saw nothing but my own reflection, with my hair cut down by a long, loose beard, and a large, yellow circle cut across the back of my head.I stood there for a moment, not sure if this was the real me again, or just some warped reflection. \n\nThen, as I did so, I noticed I could actually see myself in the mirror. I was gone, but I would always be here.In the meantime, Alex, Chris, and the others were moving in. I was now in a new house. My clothes were dirty from being buried underneath the debris, and Alex was having the hardest time adjusting to all the different faces and voices that now made their way into the kitchen and living room. \n\nIt took a while for him to get comfortable with them, but he has yet to feel truly relaxed about it. He often goes off in his mind The last thing I saw was Chris and Alex leave the house and arrive at the same house I had just left. Not long after, I heard the loud crack of the door being closed again. I ran out of the kitchen and into my bedroom, trying to get used to the idea of being alone again. I knew this was one of the worst ways to spend it, because I had to get back to the house as soon as possible. I got up, got ready, and went back to my room. \n\nAs I was leaving the kitchen, I heard my phone ring. I turned my head and noticed it was my mom. She was surprised at my sudden appearance, and excited to see me again. It was early as well, and she was already halfway out of the house.I turned around and looked back at the door. I couldn’t see anything, but it was moving with every step I took. I was staring at the door, just a few feet away from the door on my side of the backyard, and couldn’t move. \n\nIt was getting closer.\n\nI quickly opened the door and let in Mom. She turned and looked at me and smiled. \n\n“How was your trip, sweetie?” I looked at her, and her smile was genuine.`

I started wondering whether someone had just been messing around with this and that video archive, or if they’d even been able to play it before. \n\nAfter playing the tape and turning the volume down all the way, I heard the familiar voice of my grandmother telling me what to do.I turned off the light and took a moment to reflect on her words: ‘He said you should go shopping!’‘Really? I want to go to the store! But I don’t have money!’I stared at her for a moment before responding.‘Yes, Aunt Debbie, that is all very sweet of you, but it really isn’t a problem.’‘What about mom? I didn’t bring a car.’ she said.\n\nShe laughed, then looked up at me. ‘You brought your own car.’I smiled back, remembering how my dad brought his own car when he moved in here from Indiana in 1994.‘You know, honey, I think we could take a walk over to the grocery store, and grab a couple of ice cream sandwiches, and maybe find I never went back because I don’t have money,’ she said.\n\nI nodded, and then realized I’d got the wrong idea.‘Are you sure mom?’‘Sure, mom.’ It was almost like she was just talking to me, or a robot. I really couldn’t tell.‘Well, who knows,’ I said, picking up the phone. ‘Maybe they’re just having a little fun with us, and I should get back to my house first thing tomorrow.‘We should go to the park. It’s a little cold out.’She paused but didn’t say anything. It seemed to me she was just waiting to see if I was up to the challenge. But then, once I heard what she had to say, and after trying to think of a way into getting home, I got to thinking. My mom was right. I shouldn’t bother them. If I had a car, I’d leave it at the gas station, and they’d be just fine. Maybe I could come back tomorrow. \n\nI got no idea where this park was. \n\nI had to find it.`

He turned around and smiled at me, saying “You look great!”\n\nHe also appeared to be somewhat older than myself, with his hair hanging down like he had grown stubble. His suit was tailored to suit his body type. A large black bow-tie hung from his collar with some gold plating over the tie. His lips were slightly thin and he wore a black slicked-back baseball cap on his head.\n\nAs he looked at me, his eyes suddenly lit up. “Let’s go to the lab,” he said and we both ran up the stairs to the laboratory.\n\n“I have something to ask you Doctor,” he introduced himself without a pause. \n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Oh, nothing Doctor Then the screaming started, and I heard you two say that you were going to take the stairs without looking. How did you know?”\n\n“I thought it was because it was in that particular house,” I replied. \n\n“I’ll check every single house in the town.”He nodded and began to walk past me. \n\nAs he passed by the first house, he seemed to catch my attention. \n\nHe reached into the pocket of his suit and pulled out a small notebook.“It’s my notebook, I wrote everything down. I remember every single detail about who I am and what I see. \n\nI know you are going to be going with me.”I didn’t know what to say. “Alright,” he said and turned to begin walking back towards the stairs.“Now you have been through enough for a week, so I will let you off,” he said and walked away.A few hours later, we found a little park called Lake Park, complete with an artificial lake in the middle. We got the entire park in for free, and bought a couple of picnic chairs from a nearby local store.`

I guess they’d expected this kind of response from the waves, but it wasn’t what they felt. The water around us was rushing up and pushing them further out.

I almost pushed it, but it grabbed my arm. It was holding me as tightly as I could, until it had yanked me into the water and made me look down at the beach. It made me turn my head to look at the face again, but didn’t move. Then it came and dragged me out of the water.\n\nThe water was already too deep. I couldn’t swim. I could do nothing.

She was taking a trip with her friends.\n\nI stood by the bathroom door waiting for my mom, and then I saw her come out of the bathroom.\n\nI saw her and her friends and then she disappeared down the stairs, and I heard the sound of the door closing behind her.\n\nI had to turn around, but I was too scared to make it to the floor, I couldn’t.\n\nI was so confused I didn’t even know where to look, so I tried to walk back towards the door and turned it, but it opened at the last second without me turning around to look at it.\n\nI was so confused I almost didn’t turn around. I turned around and walked to the door again.\n\nI waited and waited with my heart pounding.`

It was morning, I remembered it so well.\n\nEveryone’s voices sounded cheerful, they’d be talking to me now, as if nothing had happened that morning.\n\nI had no idea what to say or where to start.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nThe woman on a chair outside her room, sitting in her bed staring out at me, hands still gripping her nightgown, her face a mask of complete happiness and serenity.\n\nShe walked calmly towards my room and took the nightgown from me, putting on her glasses so I could see her again.\n\nShe smiled at me and kissed me. She made a noise like she was about to laugh when she reached her bed, but I didn’t hear it.\n\nIt was too quiet. I felt tears spring up in the corners of my eyes.\n\nI sat down beside her, her smile still framed in perfect focus.\n\nShe tilted her head slightly and whispered something into her pillow.\n\nThen she sat down, and as she did, she said “I am not lying to you. I have seen everything. It whispered my name, but the voice belonged to someone else. I know who she is. She is alive. I have waited so long to find her. I have waited so long to see her again. I…”\n\nShe broke down, sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nI remember the confusion and unease she put on my face.\n\n“Is she… the girl?” she asked me.\n\n“Yes, I think so. The one you saw in the park? I think so too. The girl who died last night. I believe she’s alive.”\n\nWhat she said had terrified me.\n\nA voice from beyond my bedroom door. “What is going on?”\n\nI felt her hand on my shoulder.\n\n“I know you were there,” she said softly.\n\n“I know you were home. I know you were with your friends. I know the house was empty. My house was empty, too.”\n\nShe stopped and put her hands gently around my head.\n\n“I was lonely, and scared. I’m here now,” she said.\n\nMy head turned to see her, her light shimmering, her smile so bright, it seemed to glow from inside.\n\n“You can come back to me. You must.`

It opened up to a folder titled “Steven”. If this all sounds familiar then you’ve seen my other post, “Steven”.“Steven? Steven?!” I heard a voice call out in delight from the corner of the room.

I turned around and saw Alex and Marlene standing there smiling at me. I grinned as I turned around.

They were my parents. Their faces were still full of joy, but they were no longer smiling.

I could hear their breath in the hallway behind us, their soft and gentle voices filled the air.“Goodnight dear,” they both said.“Goodnight dad,” I smiled and turned towards them and returned the grin.

“Well honey,” I said, “I’m going back to bed. I’ll see you tomorrow!”“Yeah, sure!”

I turned and walked out, not really wanting to talk to Steven anymore.I made for the door before turning back, and ran down to my computer as fast as I could It was smiling at me with too many teeth, “We’ll be taking over this year!”

I was just about to get back into the computer when I heard the click or click of a key.

I turned to look at the computer and saw that my computer had been locked. The screen was blank.

“Alex, we’re going to do it!” I grabbed my phone, and I clicked. I looked at the screen.

It was the game from college that I knew from my childhood.“Steven?” I called out.I had no idea what I was going to say.

I heard a click and turned around and saw Alex stepping out onto the hallway. He was wearing a shirt and tie and he had on a red bow-tie.

He smiled at me as he stepped out, “You, uh… You, you look familiar!”

I looked over my shoulder and noticed the red bow-tie. “Oh look, Steven, we’re here! Come look at this.”

He held out his hand and he had this odd looking, black bow-tie with a gold chain.

I couldn’t see it, but his fingers were long and thin and he had short black hair.`

It was burning people. They’re dead! My wife and children are gone! I can’t believe it anymore.

I don’t know what to do. I have no idea how to stop it.”The voice stopped. “What…what do you want me to do?”

She didn’t respond. “Come get me. Come get me.”The phone died.No response. No answer. No words.

Her breathing grew shorter.Her eyes bulged. The sky filled with white, her lips thinned. A silent silence gripped her thoughts as she stared at the camera in the back of the car.She wasn’t moving.She was still breathing.No breath.No sound. Just silence.

Then, her pulse pounded in my ears. It thumped along the lines. Not an emotion. But a pulse. No color. No expression. A heartbeat.

Then, slowly, its voice faded to nothing. A whisper. Something raw: A plea.“Loved ones. Your children. Your loved ones.”No response.But a voice. A whisper. A cry.A call.A promise.

My son. His smile was wide—smile as long as he The worst part is, it was wearing my face, like a mask. And the voice was gone.

I didn’t want to see it. I felt it in the bottom of my stomach. Like a voice, the kind you don’t want to hear. It was coming from the car door. It didn’t scream. But it didn’t grow quiet.

It started to fill the car with its presence. Like a voice, a whisper. And then the car started to turn. A slow, quiet, and silent turn. A turn toward the house.

I turned to the mirror. No face. No expression. Just silence.

I watched people drive by. They didn’t look at me. They saw the reflection, but they didn’t care. Instead, they looked around. Looking for something. Something they’d forgotten was wrong. Something to fix. Something to save. They stopped themselves.

We turned the car around and drove to the house, past the woods. I tried to drive back, but it was too late. The mirror was gone, and nothing remained.

I didn’t see what it was that was behind it.

I heard the sound of the windshield breaking. It sounded like an arrow hit a target.`

When the doctor left, I told him I wanted to go into the store to get some food, and he suggested I go on. He asked me if I felt comfortable going there alone.

“Of course I do, Mommy. You don’t understand how much food I need. Don’t you ever forget what a dear and precious gift food is?

The moment I went to the supermarket in the middle of the night, I felt my stomach drop; I really had no idea what I would be able to eat without help. What could I possibly think about while someone was helping me?”

I explained that I thought about it all night, and decided she couldn’t tell me what to eat for dinner. She asked what I would want for dinner anyway. So I told her the answer: spaghetti. The soup, of course.

So we got into our car and drove toward the grocery store. It was an ordinary grocery store. I didn’t even have to open the door, as she had already placed a plastic tub of spaghetti on the counter with two plates. We ate spaghetti and water, and then went shopping.

We bought a few more things from the store Then the lights flickered and I heard, “Come for one quick bite, little lady.”

She leaned over to the counter and picked up one of the spaghetti. I didn’t see why she was helping me, but as she ate, I could see she was breathing heavily.

I saw her teeth turn into little black dots on her tongue. I saw her eyes get bigger and she’s trying to reach for a tomato.

I ran outside to grab a tomato, and she grabbed a bowl of spaghetti in her hand.“Momma, what are you doing?!” she yelled in horror at the sight.

I tried to explain to her what’s happening, but she didn’t listen. She ran out of the store, screaming and crying, and I saw her running into the house to get an umbrella.

I ran back inside and got a towel. But she was crying even more. She had an argument with her son about homework, and she wanted him to go to the hospital. She’d been crying all night.

I went to the hospital, and the doctor told me it was nothing, nothing more than a bad case of bronchitis. I was so shocked that I started crying again.`

As I glanced over at my camera feed, there stood a man. He stood staring straight at me as I turned around.

He was standing there in the exact same silhouette as the reflection from the mirror I’d seen in that dream.

He was tall, but I didn’t recognize him; as he approached my frame, his stature increased. His features were altered.

His skin became thinner. His eyes grew larger and more clear.

As he walked by me, his skin tightened even further around the edges, almost like he was wearing a mask. The man's eyes seemed to glow with something darker than light, and a wicked grin carved onto his lips.

When he came to my frame, the smile disappeared for a moment, but it came back like nothing had happened.As he approached my frame, he looked towards me.

For a second, it appeared as if he were grinning, but it quickly became apparent he was not smiling.

His hands shook as he raised one finger and moved it sideways, just slightly away from my face.

I couldn’t help but shudder as he made contact, and as he drew closer, the The door locked from the outside and, for a second, I could make out a figure standing in the doorway of the house.

This was not my imagination, but it was more like a reenactment of the appearance of my reflection in that dream.It was a man I had seen in that dream, but in the mirror.

I could hear the creak of the door as my reflection walked by.

I turned around, startled, and it wasn’t the same man.

I was now being seen by that man, and the mirror of the mirror had been fixed.

It looked so real again, in the exact same way it had when I’d first seen it in that dream.

I turned back around and walked towards the mirror again, but the man was already gone.

I walked slowly towards the doorway and closed it as I turned to face the mirror again.I was staring at my reflection again, just a few feet away.

I couldn’t see it, but I could hear it, and it sounded like a low, metallic voice.

It was the same voice as my father had heard in that dream.

He stopped pacing, and his head fell back and his jaw tightened.

I turned around again, and his face was gone.`

As I pulled the door shut behind me, I heard an ominous rumble and saw Alex running from his house towards the door. He was going fast!

I ran too and looked through the door to see he was just in front of the door. He let out a short cry for help and I followed him in the same direction he came from.

There was nothing out there and the noise in the hallway began subsiding to nothing. I continued running with my head down and I turned to see Matt looking back at me, wide eyed and panicked.

My panic grew as I quickly realized we weren’t even supposed to be in the woods anymore and that the door had been left unlocked so that it wouldn’t be noticed until we broke it.

I felt like my whole body was trembling and I tried to keep my legs together but my arms kept me upright.“What? What is it?” I said.

Matt turned and walked over to me, his hand still gripping my The walls started to bleed, their windows were shattered.

I looked at Matt and saw him looking at me with the same eyes that had haunted me since the day I first saw my dog. “What is it?” I said again.“Mornin’, honey.”

“What are you scared of?” he asked, his voice shaking.

I was feeling more than scared, I was afraid of what was next. He reached over and brought his hand up to mine and I saw that his palm was raw.

It was a scratch and I felt a tug on my hand. He then turned and made his way towards the door, my pulse racing and I could feel his breath as he drew near.

I was trying to shut it but I couldn’t get the door to close.

I pulled the door to the hallway to open it and the sound of the door creaking closed was the last thing I remembered.

It was dark now, and I couldn’t see anything, but if I could just breathe it would be all the same.

I heard his footsteps again and I moved slowly to the doorway and opened it, slowly opening the door. I saw Matt, his eyes still red from fear and his breath quickening.`

If you hear three knocks at the door after sunset, do not answer.
If you hear a single, hard knock, open the door, but do not look at who stands there.
Hold out a basket of freshly baked bread and wait until you hear the footsteps leaving to shut the door.
If you hear someone call your name from the woods, do not answer.
If you see a figure at the tree line wearing a wide-brimmed hat, do not look at him for longer than one second.
If you hear chains dragging on the ground, sprinkle salt on all windowsills and door thresholds within one minute.
If a candle is burning in the window of the old, abandoned Anderson cabin up the hill, stay indoors, no matter what.
If the dog barks at the empty corner, leave the room backwards.
Do not whistle at night, for the wind will whistle back with a voice that is not yours.
If the fire turns blue, a spirit is passing through the chimney; cover your mouth.
Never follow a light that moves against the wind.
If you find a comb on the trail, leave it; the owner is looking for a way in.
The trees remember the blood spilled at their roots, so do not sleep beneath the weeping willow.
If the cicadas stop buzzing all at once, something is listening to your breathing.
Don't look at the moon through a reflection in the water, or you will see the face of your death.
If a stranger offers you water in a cup made of bone, decline politely and walk west.
When the fog smells of sulfur, the gate is open.
If you hear a baby crying in the deep woods, run the other way; it is a mimic.
Do not acknowledge the shadow that stands by your bed; it feeds on attention.
If the milk sours in an hour, the Little Folk are in the pantry.
If you smell wet earth in your bedroom, do not look under the bed.
The man with the backwards hands asks for directions; point him to the graveyard.
If the birds fly into your window, the debt has come due.
If you hike where the fog clings low to the pine, And the wind through the hollow hums mournful in time, Then heed what the old ones have carved into lore, Or you won’t leave the woods like you’ve left them before.
When daylight is dying, be back in your bed, For the dusk wakes the ones that remember the dead.
Don’t open for knocking, don’t answer your name, If it stands on two legs but don’t move the same.
If you hear a soft song where no singer should be, Keep walking and humming, eyes down, don’t you dare see.
Leave bread on the stump if you’ve borrowed the trail, Or the Little Ones curse you with more than just ail.
Don’t wave at the figure who waits in the field, It knows you’ve now seen it and won’t stay concealed.
Don’t speak of the thing that you glimpsed in the trees, What’s named becomes real, and it’ll find you with ease.
If silence falls sudden, then hush every breath, For the quiet in woods is the herald of death.
Three pennies at crossroads, don’t ask, just obey, Or you’ll owe a fare that you can’t ever pay.
Don’t cut at the oak with a face in the bark, Its roots run through bones buried deep in the dark.
If a man joins your fire and don’t meet your gaze, Offer food, speak no questions, and part ways with praise.
Don’t fish past the hour when the moon’s at its height, What bites past that mark drags you down out of sight.
Mark ash on your door come the coldest of nights, To ward off the shadows that dance without light.
If you wake up with dirt on the soles of your feet, Say thanks and lie down, don’t recall, don’t repeat. And pray, not the way that the preacher man said, But the tongue of your grandma, who speaks to the dead.
